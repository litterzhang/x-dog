"""Tests for the skill tool — the path by which a claw agent reads a skill.

There are two places skill text reaches a model: coding's system prompt and
this tool. The first was fixed to resolve a skill's file references; this one
was left returning the raw body, so the same bug stayed live behind a different
caller. These tests pin the contract on this side of it.
