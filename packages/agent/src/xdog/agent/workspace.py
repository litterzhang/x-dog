"""Workspace policy — what a run may touch, and how each node kind is held to it.

One module because the two halves must agree, and because both of flow's engines
need them and a generated module cannot import flow.

The two halves are enforced very differently, and the difference is the design
rather than an accident of implementation:

* **Agent nodes are told.** :func:`workspace_briefing` puts the workspace and the
  granted directories in the system prompt. Nothing checks that the model obeys —
  a node's tools are its own, an agent can be handed any tool at all, and there is
  no chokepoint where every possible tool's file access could be inspected. So
  this is a *promise the agent keeps*, stated plainly, and worth having because a
  model that is told where its files go puts them there.

* **Script nodes are audited.** :func:`script_bound` installs a PEP 578 audit
  hook that refuses paths outside the bound. This is real enforcement against
  code that is not trying to escape.

**The audit hook is containment, not a sandbox.** It runs in the executor's own
interpreter, where the hook function is a reachable, mutable object; a script
that wants out can reassign the closure cell holding the roots, or overwrite
``_hook.__code__``, both in about two lines. Immutable roots and deleting the
module-level name do not help — this was tested, not assumed. What it does stop,
completely, is the realistic failure: a script that wanders, builds a path from a
bad input, or was written without knowing where it was allowed to write. Nothing
here defends against a script authored to defeat it; that needs a child process
and an OS bound (see ``docs/script-node-confinement.md``).
