"""Skill manager — load, save, list, patch, remove skills.

Skills come from three tiers, each overriding the one before it:

- **Packaged** — ``<installed package>/skill/`` — discovered, read-only
- **Shared** — ``{data_dir}/skills/`` — available to all groups
- **Group** — ``{workspace}/skills/`` — specific to one group

Packaged skills arrive with the distributions the user installed, so
``pip install xdog-flow`` is all it takes for an agent to know how to write a
flow workflow. They are read-only: they live in site-packages, and a user who
wants to change one shadows it by saving a skill with the same slug, which
lands in the shared tier and wins.

New skills are saved to the shared directory by default (so other groups
benefit). Use ``scope="group"`` to save a group-specific skill.
