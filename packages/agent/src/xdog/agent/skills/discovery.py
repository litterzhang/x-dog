"""Discovering skills that ship inside installed packages.

A distribution can carry a skill by putting a ``skill/SKILL.md`` inside its
package directory — ``xdog-flow`` does, teaching an agent to write flow
workflows. Nothing has to be registered: this walks the ``xdog`` namespace and
picks up whatever is installed, so ``pip install xdog-flow`` makes the skill
appear and ``pip uninstall`` makes it go away.

That matters more than it sounds. The alternative — copying SKILL.md into a
user-level skills directory — was how this was done before, and the copy
silently drifted from the package it documented, teaching the agent an API that
had already changed underneath it. Reading it out of the installed package is
the only version that cannot go stale.
