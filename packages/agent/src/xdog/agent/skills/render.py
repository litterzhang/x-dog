"""Making a skill's file references resolvable.

A skill may ship files beside its ``SKILL.md`` — the standard names
``scripts/``, ``references/`` and ``assets/`` as conventions — and says to
reference them by paths relative to the skill root. That instruction is only
followable if the reader knows where the root is, and a model reading the body
does not: it sees ``examples/essay_writer.json`` and resolves it against the
working directory, where nothing of the sort exists.

Our own shipped skill had exactly this bug. It tells the agent to "read the
closest example and copy its shape" and ships twelve of them, and every one of
those paths was unresolvable — a failure that produces a confused agent rather
than an error, which is why it survived being written, reviewed and packaged.

Two halves to the fix. Explicit ``${SKILL_DIR}`` markers are substituted, and
the directory is stated up front so that bare relative paths — the form the
standard actually recommends — resolve too, with no change to the skill.

    Ahead rather than after: a skill teaches a format or a procedure, and the
    caller's prompt is the task expressed in it. Appending it instead reads as an
    afterthought attached to instructions the model has already committed to.

    An unresolvable slug is skipped. Callers that care -- flow validates its
    workflows at load -- should refuse before reaching here, because an agent
    told to produce a format it was never shown does not fail, it produces
    something plausible and wrong.

    *search_dirs* are directories holding ``<slug>/SKILL.md``, searched before
    installed packages so a caller can carry its own. flow passes the ``skills/``
    directory beside the workflow file: that travels *with* the artifact, exactly
    like the sibling modules a ``run:`` node imports, so it does not reintroduce
    the ambient-machine-state problem that reading a user's own skill directory
    would.

    Lives in the agent package rather than in flow because a generated flow
    module must not import flow, and both engines have to render this the same
    way or the same workflow gets two different system prompts.
