"""Every third-party import must be declared or guarded.

`xdog-coding` 0.57.7 could not start: it imports `click` and `pydantic` and
declared neither, so it only worked when something else in the environment
happened to pull them in. On a machine with just `pip install xdog-coding` the
command died with ModuleNotFoundError before printing anything.

Nothing catches this by running the code, because the development venv has
every package's dependencies installed at once — the one environment where the
bug cannot reproduce is the one the tests run in. So check the metadata against
the imports directly.

`claw` was missing `httpx` and `qrcode` outright and bare-imported `croniter`
from an optional group; `site` was missing `python-frontmatter` and
`markupsafe`. Three packages, one mistake, no failing test between them.
