# One agent, many channels — separating who you are talking to from how

Status: **design, not built** · Prompted by: a WeChat message creating a second
agent with a second memory and a second persona

## The problem, precisely

`group_id` does two jobs at once:

| Job | Used by |
|---|---|
| **Conversation identity** — which session, workspace, MEMORY.md, IDENTITY.md, goals, scheduled tasks | `GroupRuntime`, `SessionManager`, everything under `groups/<id>/` |
| **Delivery address** — which person on which channel gets the reply | `WeixinChannel._user_id_map: group_id → wechat user id` |

Because they are the same string, a new channel or a new peer *necessarily*
creates a new conversation. `_weixin_user_id_to_group_id("abc@im.wechat")`
returns `weixin:abc-im-wechat`, `auto_register_group` creates it, and
`init_workspace` seeds it with default identity files — which is why the agent
answered "my identifier is weixin:o9cq…" and offered to be given a better name.
Nothing was misconfigured. The name it read was the routing key.

## The design

**A group is a conversation. A channel is a way to reach it.**

An inbound message carries both, and they are no longer the same field:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class InboundMessage:
    group_id: str        # which conversation this belongs to
    origin: Origin       # where it came from, and where a reply goes back
    text: str

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Origin:
    channel: str         # "weixin", "tui", ...
    peer: str            # the channel's own address for that person
```

Three consequences:

1. **The session is keyed by `group_id` alone.** TUI and WeChat land in the same
   history, the same MEMORY.md, the same persona. Asking on your phone continues
   what you said at your desk, which is the point.
2. **A reply follows the message it answers**, via `origin` — not by looking the
   group up in a channel-owned map. `_send_to_channels(group_id, text)` becomes
   `reply(origin, text)`. This is what makes many channels per group possible at
   all: the current broadcast has to guess, and guesses right only because each
   group has exactly one channel today.
3. **`_user_id_map` stops being routing state** and becomes what it always was:
   the channel's own address book, consulted by `origin.peer`.

## The decision this needs, and why it is not mine to make

If every WeChat sender maps to the same group, **anyone who messages the bot is
talking to your assistant, with your memory**. They can ask it what it knows
about you and it will answer, because that is one conversation now.

So a peer has to be *admitted* to a group. Three ways, in increasing safety:

| | How | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| **First sender wins** | the first peer to talk on a channel is bound to `main`; later peers get their own group | zero setup; whoever messages first owns it, and on a public bot that is not necessarily you |
| **Explicit bind** | `xdog-claw channel bind weixin <peer> --group main` | one command per channel; you have to find your own peer id first |
| **Allowlist in config** | `weixin_owner_ids: [...]`, unknown senders refused | editing a file; safest, and unknown peers get a clear refusal rather than a private group |

Unbound peers should get **their own group, or nothing** — never the owner's.
The failure to avoid is silent: a stranger's message answered from your memory,
with no signal that it happened.

## What else moves with the group

Merging channels into one group merges everything keyed by it, which is the
intent but worth stating: memory, conversation history, goals, scheduled tasks,
and the group's `skills/`. A scheduled task created "in WeChat" then fires for
the one conversation, and its output goes wherever the reply for that turn is
addressed.

## Migration

`groups/weixin:o9cq…-im-wechat/` already holds real history. Two honest options:

- **Abandon it.** Simplest, and loses whatever was said there.
- **Merge it into `main`.** Requires deciding how two conversation histories
  interleave, which is a real question with no obvious answer — timestamps
  produce a transcript that never happened.

For a few turns of history the first is better. Say so in the release note
rather than quietly dropping a directory.

## Effort

| Step | Work |
|---|---|
| `Origin` on inbound/outbound, `reply(origin, …)` replacing broadcast | 1d |
| Channel resolves peer → group through a binding table, default `main` | 0.5d |
| Bind command + config allowlist, and a refusal path for unknown peers | 0.5d |
| Tests: two channels one session; a reply goes only to its origin; an unbound peer is refused | 0.5d |

The third row is the one that must not be skipped. Without it this design is a
privacy hole with better ergonomics.
