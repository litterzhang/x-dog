# Where a skill's body belongs, for prompt caching

Status: **partly done** — `Agent` now owns placement; `coding` not yet migrated · Raised while adding `skills:` to flow agent
nodes · Owner: whoever next touches `xdog-coding`'s system prompt

## Done since this was written

`Agent` takes `skills=[...]` and decides placement itself: a session-scoped skill
goes in the system prompt, a `scope: turn` one goes in as a message. Resolution
stays with the caller — flow looks beside its workflow and in packages, coding in
its group and shared directories — because only the caller knows where to look.
Placement is the same everywhere because only one place decides it.

flow is migrated. **`coding` is not**: it still builds a skills section into
`build_system_prompt` and calls `_rebuild_system_prompt()` when the active set
changes, which is the case this note is about.

## What was true when this was written

**flow** (`skills_preamble` in `SdkRunner` / `_run_agent`): the body goes at the
**front of the system prompt**, and a node's system prompt is built once and
never changed. That is the good case — a stable prefix, cacheable in full.

**coding** (`agent_session._skills_section` → `build_system_prompt`): the body is
also in the system prompt, so the original worry — "it might be in a user
message" — does not apply. But `_rebuild_system_prompt()` is called whenever the
active skill set changes (`agent_session.py:101,108,117,162`), and a skill with
`expires_after_turn` changes it **every turn**.

## The thing to actually look at

Prompt caching keys on the **prefix**. The system prompt is the very first thing
in it, so editing the system prompt invalidates the cache for the entire
conversation — not just for the part that changed.

That inverts the intuition. For a skill that is *declared once and never
changes*, the system prompt is exactly right. For a skill that is *activated and
expired mid-conversation*, putting the body in the system prompt is the most
expensive available choice: every activation and every expiry re-sends the whole
conversation uncached.

Appending the body as a message instead would keep the cached prefix intact,
because messages accumulate at the end. That is worth measuring before changing
anything — the claim here is about how caching works, not a measurement of what
it costs in this codebase.

## The distinction that decides it

| | Skill set | Where the body belongs |
|---|---|---|
| flow agent node | declared in the workflow, fixed for the run | system prompt (already) |
| coding session | activated by `/slug`, may expire after a turn | probably a message, not a system-prompt edit |

So this is not one bug with one fix. It is: *static skills belong in the prefix,
dynamic skills belong after it*, and coding currently puts both in the prefix.

## Resolved: do not migrate coding or claw

Measured, as this note told itself to. Neither is wrong.

**claw was already right.** Its skill bodies come back through `tool_skill.py`
as a *tool result*, which is a message — after the prefix, exactly the shape this
note was going to recommend. Only the stable one-line summary sits in its system
prompt.

**coding's cache is not being thrashed.** `build_system_prompt` takes
`(config, tools, file_entries, extra_context)` and contains no clock, uuid or
cwd, so the rebuild before every turn produces byte-identical text and the cache
hits. Rebuilding is free; *changing* is what costs, and the text only changes
when the user runs `/skill` or `/unload`.

**And moving it would break what it is for.** `activate_skill`'s docstring says
bodies live in the system prompt because a message cannot be taken back out of a
conversation — that is what makes `/unload` work. Trading a working feature for a
cache problem that does not occur is a bad deal.

## The one thing still worth doing, if it ever matters

No skill anywhere sets `scope: turn`, so the expiry path never fires. If one ever
does, coding will rebuild its system prompt *every turn*, and that is the case
this note was worried about — a real cliff, currently unreachable.

The fix then is not to move everything: it is to route only turn-scoped bodies
through `Agent(skills=...)`, which already places them as messages, and leave
session-scoped ones in the system prompt where `/unload` can reach them. Small,
and worth doing at the moment the first turn-scoped skill is written rather than
before.
